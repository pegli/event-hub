title: Budget
---

We are confident that we can complete the tasks listed in the primary scope of work
section of the City's RFP for the Event Hub project on time and under the stated
budget of $50,000.  We are unable to provide exact cost numbers without additional
information about the project, however.  Some of the questions that have come up during the
preparation of this proposal include:

* To what extent will the contract team be responsible for providing quality assurance
  and testing services?
* Has a detailed graphic design for the Event Hub web site been created?  If not, and
  if the visual design of the site is important to the City, we may need to subcontract a
  web designer.
* How many media publishers will be integrating with the site at the time of launch,
  and to what extent will they be responsible for integration work?  Will the Event Hub
  provide a single API that they call, or will the contract team be working on custom
  integration points for each publisher?
* What features are required in the Client Importer UI?

We look forward to conversations with the City and the stakeholders to clarify the open
issues in the Event Hub design so we can come up with a more accurate budget estimate
for the project.

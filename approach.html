        <h1>Overview of Requirements</h1>
        <p>
          The City of Santa Cruz Event Hub is a central, community-based event database that replaces
          the current ad-hoc collection of calendars maintained by media organizations.  The Event Hub
          will:
          <ul>
            <li>provide event producers and sponsors with a centralized web site for publishing information
              about their venues and upcoming events in the city</li>
            <li>simplify the process of publishing customized calendar feeds for web, social, and
              traditional media</li>
            <li>save time for event attendees by connecting an event with social media and ticket purchase
              options</li>
          </ul>
          Unlike existing commercial event calendar services, the Event Hub will be focused on the Santa Cruz
          community and will give producers the ability to communicate and coordinate the local event schedules.
          For example, the producer of a folk music artist could search for appropriate venues in the Event
          Hub and for the dates of performances tagged "folk music" to find the best time and place for their
          artist's concert in Santa Cruz.  A local solution also benefits media outlets with an existing web
          presence, like the <a href="http://www.gtweekly.com/index.php/all-about-santa-cruz-activities-visitors-guide.html">Good Times</a>
          and <a href="http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/entertainment">Santa Cruz Sentinel</a>, by providing
          hands-on integration assistance and quick turnaround of feature requests and improvements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first phase of the Event Hub deployment will consist of a secure web site where event producers
          can register for an account, enter information about venues, schedule events, and publish events
          to Facebook.  The site will provide an HTTP-based, RESTful API for
          publishers to use to fetch event information in a variety of formats for display on their web sites.
          Stretch goals for the initial version of the site will be a Wordpress calendar plugin and the ability
          to publish to external calendaring services like Eventbrite and Meetup.
        </p>
        <h1>Implementation</h1>
        <h2>Platform</h2>
        <p>
          The core of the Event Hub service will be an <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">Apache CouchDB</a>
          server.  CouchDB is a stable and secure open-source "NoSQL" database that stores data documents in
          <a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a> format and provides an HTTP API for creating, modifying,
          and transforming stored documents.  CouchDB is extremely scalable, easy to maintain, and has been used by
          <a href="http://www.ocastalabs.com/wp-content/uploads/CouchDB-Case-Study-Agora.pdf">commercial</a>,
          and <a href="http://readwrite.com/2010/08/26/lhc-couchdb">government</a> entities for data storage
          since 2005.  The CouchDB project recently released <a href="http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/changelog.html#version-1-3-0">version 1.3.0</a> and
          dramatically improved its documentation site, a strong indication that the project is healthy and active.
          Several companies provide hosting and support services for CouchDB.  While the Event Hub service
          will be hosted at Cruzio, it is always desirable to have options for future support and expansion.
        </p>
        <p>
          CouchDB is a natural fit for the Event Hub requirements.  Originally written by
          <a href="http://www.couchbase.com/leadership">Damien Katz</a> to be the "database of the Internet,"
          it was designed from the ground up to both store data and host web applications that operate on
          that data.  The server does not require predefined schemas or document formats, leaving the
          structures of the documents up to the application developer and allowing those structures to evolve
          over time as needs change.  While JSON is the native format of a document, CouchDB provides
          a means of <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Formatting_with_Show_and_List">transforming</a>
          documents and collections of documents to any arbitrary format.  For example, a JSON document representing
          an event venue could be transformed to HTML for presentation in a web browser, or a collection of
          events could be converted to <a href="http://www.atomenabled.org/developers/syndication/">Atom syndication format</a>
          for publication.  Documents may contain any number of binary attachments that can also be accessed
          through the built-in HTTP server.  Attachments are usually used to hold media associated with a document
          and are a perfect fit for storing photos and video.
        </p>
        <p>
          CouchDB can store HTML pages, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files as data documents
          and serve them over HTTP, removing the need for a separate application server.  A web application
          served by CouchDB and operating on CouchDB data documents is known as a "couchapp."  Some example
          couchapps can be viewed on the <a href="http://couchapp.org/page/index">CouchApp project home page</a>.
          There are several tools available for assembling files into a couchapp document and publishing
          the app to a CouchDB server.  The event producer web site and administrative web site will be written as
          couchapps.
        </p>
        <p>
          CouchDB ships with a built-in user database, role-based security, and support for both HTTP Basic
          and OAuth authentication.  For additional security, the Event Hub service will run behind a
          <a href="http://haproxy.1wt.eu">HAProxy</a> software load balancer/HTTP proxy which will limit the
          HTTP requests that are forwarded to CouchDB to a set of predefined URLs.  Combining CouchDB with
          an HTTP proxy is a common configuration for public-facing couchapps.
        </p>
        <p>
          A single installation of CouchDB can store many millions of documents and attachments.  Our team has
          deployed services based on CouchDB that host over five million documents and several terabytes of
          storage on a single physical server without any issues in service availability or response time.
          If the scope of the Event Hub project eventually includes a requirement for high availability, we can use
          CouchDB's <a href="http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/replication.html">replication</a> feature to synchronize
          data between two or more physical servers and HAProxy to load balance requests among the servers.
          Replication can also be used by developers to pull a copy of the production database to their local
          machines to test couchapps prior to deployment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any periodic tasks like exports or backups that need to be initiated by the Event Hub service will
          be written in a scripting language appropriate to the task.  For example, an "export to Eventbrite"
          process might be implemented in Python using their <a href="http://developer.eventbrite.com/doc/#libraries">client library</a>.
        </p>
        
        
        <h2>Workflow</h2>
        <p>
          This section describes how the Event Hub will be used by producers and publishers.
        </p>
        
        <h3>First-time Producer</h3>
        <p>
          Phil is the vice-president of the Santa Cruz Rustic Roses gardening club.  Over the past few years,
          the club has grown mainly by word-of-mouth, with only a handful of gardeners attending the monthly
          meetings.  The club has decided to hold an open house at Jenny's place overlooking the harbor to
          attract people who are interested in talking about roses.  Phil is in charge of promoting this event.
          He remembers reading about the new City of Santa Cruz Event Hub web site in the Sentinel, so he
          browses the online edition until he finds a link to the Event Hub web site.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once he opens the site on his laptop, Phil looks over the home page, which explains what the site
          does and shows a couple of example events.  He finds the "Register" button right away -- it's big
          and near the top of the screen -- clicks it, and enters his name and email address in the first
          fields of the provided form.  The next section of the form asks if he is an individual, a club, or
          a company.  Phil selects "club" and is shown an alphabetical list of all of the clubs already registered in
          the Hub.  Santa Cruz Rustic Roses isn't in the list, so he selects "New Club" and types in the club
          name and the contact information for Arlene, the president of the club.  Finally, Phil picks a
          password and completes the registration form.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the main screen, Phil sees a list of his venues (empty) and a list of events (also empty).  He
          clicks on the "Add Event" button at the bottom of the event list and is taken to the new event
          entry page.  He fills in the date of the open house, adds "Rustic Roses Open House" in the title
          field, types in a short description, and clicks on 
          the "Publish" button.  A popup appears that says, "You haven't selected a venue for your event.  Would
          you like to do that now?"  Phil clicks on the "Yes" button and is taken to the new venue entry page.
          He enters Jenny's address in the new venue form, skips adding a picture, and clicks on the "Save"
          button, which takes him back to the new event entry page.  He notices that Jenny's house is now
          selected for the event venue.  Now that he's looking at the event again, Phil realizes that he isn't
          sure if they will actually be serving gluten-free snacks, so he clicks on the "Save for Later" button
          on the event entry screen and the "Logout" button at the top of the page.
        </p>
        <p>
          A quick call to Arlene confirms that there will be wheat-free cookies, so Phil goes back to his browser,
          logs in to the Event Hub, and sees the open house event in the list of his events.  He also notices that
          Jenny's house is listed under his venues.  Phil clicks on the "Publish" button next to the open house
          event and a popup appears asking him to confirm that the event is to be published.  He clicks the "Ok" 
          button, and another popup appears informing him that the event has been published to the Hub.  
        </p>
        
        <h3>Club Owner</h3>
        
        <p>
          Mike is the owner of "Mike's Mosh Pit", a club off of Ocean Street that specializes in producing local
          heavy metal bands.  The Pit has been open for almost ten years, and Mike has been using
          <a href="http://calendar.google.com/">Google Calendar</a> to keep track of his bookings.  This has
          been working well for him, but it is a pain to publish his show dates to all of the local newspapers
          and web sites.  He signed up for the Event Hub when he first heard about it and entered information about
          the club, but at the time he thought he had to enter events by hand so he logged out.  A friend told him
          that he could just upload his existing calendar, so he thought he'd give the Event Hub another shot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mike opens the Event Hub web site and clicks on the "Login" button, but realizes that he's forgotten
          his password.  He clicks on the "Forgot Password" button, enters his email address, and clicks on the
          "Send Password" button.  A few minutes later, he receives an email message instructing him to click on
          a URL in the email message to log in with a temporary password.  He follows the instructions and chooses
          a new password, writing it down so he doesn't forget it for next time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mike notices that the thumbnail picture of the Pit is old -- it was taken before he repainted the outside
          jet black.  He clicks on the venue entry and is taken to the edit venue page.  Mike clicks to remove the
          old picture, then uploads a new picture from his computer.  He also adds his new web site to the venue information,
          then clicks on the "Save" button and is taken back to the main Hub page.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the bottom of the (empty) list of events, Mike notices a new section titled "Import" with a couple of
          buttons next to it.  One of them says "Google Calendar", so he clicks on that and is taken to the iCal
          import page.  He reads the instructions for locating the URL to his Google calendar in iCal format, then
          opens a new browser window and follows them.  He copies the iCal URL from Google and pastes it into the
          import page, then clicks the "Import" button.  A cool little animated spinner graphic pops up, and a few
          seconds later, a message appears telling him that his import is complete.  Mike clicks the "Ok" button
          and is taken back to the main page.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the main page, Mike sees a list of upcoming events pulled from his Google Calendar.  Each event has a
          "Publish" button next to it.  He clicks the "Publish" button on the first event and confirms that it should
          be published, frowning a little bit as he contemplates going through that process for all 65 upcoming shows.
          He then notices a "Publish All Future Events" link at the bottom of the event list, smiles, and clicks on it.
          Mike clicks the "Ok" button in the publish all confirmation popup and is happy to see all of his upcoming
          shows published to the Hub.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later that day, the drummer for the Oozing Eyeballs calls Mike and cancels their show for the upcoming
          Friday night.  Mike opens up Google Calendar and deletes the show.  A few hours later, he remembers the
          Event Hub and logs in.  Sure enough, the Oozing Eyeballs show has been removed from the Event Hub as well.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Data Model</h2>
        <p>
          It is important to have an external definition of the data model for the documents being stored because
          CouchDB does not intrinsically provide any schema definitions.  This definition can change over time as
          new features are added or requirements are modified.
        </p>
        <h3>Producer</h3>
        <p>
          A <em>producer</em> is an individual, company, club, or organization that will be creating events in the
          Event Hub.  Examples of producers might
          include <a href="http://www.catalystclub.com">The Catalyst</a> club,
          <a href="http://www.the418.org/">The 418 Project</a>, and
          <a href="http://evening.toastmastersclubs.org/">Toastmasters</a>.
          When a user registers for the Event Hub site, they must be associated with a producer.
        </p>

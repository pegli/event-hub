of the supporting server-side infrastructure for the best selling [MotionX-GPS](http://gps.motionx.com/)

# Heather MIETZ EGLI
### Project Management

Heather has over 15 years of technical and general project management. She has worked successfully
with very diverse team members and stakeholders - from engineers to academics, students to high-level
executives. She attributes her project management success to the following attributes: outstanding
communication and follow-up, research until the answer is found, and extreme organizational skills. 

An oft-overlooked important aspect of any successful project is a series of well-run meetings.
Realizing this early on,  Heather makes it her mission to have agreed-upon agendas and goals entering
a meeting, keeping the focus on these, leaving the meeting with a list of action items and owners, and
lastly, distributing these notes to the team members. 

In addition to running her own business, Heather has accumulated an odd but helpful assortment of 
skills, such as software QA, marketing and outreach, and using her improv training to remain flexible
and with sense of humor intact.
